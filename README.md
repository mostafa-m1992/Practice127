"using and practicing MVP as a software architecture"/
three layer for MVP: model, presenter, view/
model for example: Api Service, Database, File/
view: activity, fragment, view. Every thing client can see	/
we make two class that one of them as model, get and stroe data from second class (user)/
another class as presenter that determines which data and when can be visible/
it's better to make a interface to use fragments or activities/
as an example we create two method to attach and detach data
